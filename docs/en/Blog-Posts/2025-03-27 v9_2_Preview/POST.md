# ABP Platform 9.2 RC Has Been Released

We are happy to release [ABP](https://abp.io) version **9.2 RC** (Release Candidate). This blog post introduces the new features and important changes in this new version.

Try this version and provide feedback for a more stable version of ABP v9.2! Thanks to you in advance.

## Get Started with the 9.2 RC

You can check the [Get Started page](https://abp.io/get-started) to see how to get started with ABP. You can either download [ABP Studio](https://abp.io/get-started#abp-studio-tab) (**recommended**, if you prefer a user-friendly GUI application - desktop application) or use the [ABP CLI](https://abp.io/docs/latest/cli).

By default, ABP Studio uses stable versions to create solutions. Therefore, if you want to create a solution with a preview version, first you need to create a solution and then switch your solution to the preview version from the ABP Studio UI:
